This is the back end and front end server for Project 5 of the Junior Web Developer path.

### Prerequisites ###

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

### Installation ###

Clone this repo. From within the project folder, run `npm install`. You 
can then go in the back end folder and run the server with `node server`. 
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.

Once the back end server is running, go in the front end folder 
and run the npm scrypt `npm run prod`. Once this command is done,
run the front end server with `npm run start`.
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `8080`
